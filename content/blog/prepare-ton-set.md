## Ticketing
Sales exploded this year: we sold 1600 2-day passes in 40 hours. We did not even have time to write this newsletter as all places have already left. ðŸŽµ ["Thunderstruck - ACDC"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2AC41dglnM) ðŸŽµ
For information, we will put up for sale places 1 day on September 10 at 10am. Attention, last year, they left in seconds. Note that there are still still places at reduced rates.
We also launched a [lottery] (https://www.billetweb.fr/devfest-Nantes-2019) for our 50 pass 2 additional days
