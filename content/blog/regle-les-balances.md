{{<centered-img src="/images/speakers/chloe_condon.jpg" alt="Chloe Condon" width="150">}}
Chloe Condon: Chloe is an SF based Senior Cloud Advocate for Microsoft. For the past 2 years, she has been working at Sentry.io, where she created the Sentry Scouts program (a camp) themed meet-up ft. patches, s'mores, giant squirrel costumes, and etc). If you could not pick up the theatricality of Chloe's meet-up, she was a professional music theater performer for over 20 years and has a BA in Performance Theater from San Francisco State University. Perhaps the only engineer you'll meet in "Hairspray", "Xanadu", "Carrie the Musical", and "Jerry Springer: the Opera" - she is passionate about bringing people to non-traditional backgrounds in the world tech. Since her graduation from Hackbright Academy in December 2016, Chloe has worked with a wide variety of developer communities and loves to help developers' lives easier. In 2018, Chloe was featured in the Grace Hopper Conference gallery featuring 15 influential women in STEM by AnitaB.org. In early 2018 was named one of the "200+ Thought Leaders in Crypto and Blockchain" and still knows absolutely nothing about Crypto and Blockchain. Seriously-not a thing. She considers it her greatest accomplishment. She is also passionate about bringing humor, empathy, and human-ness to tech. You can learn more about it in her keynote from DjangoCon 2018.
