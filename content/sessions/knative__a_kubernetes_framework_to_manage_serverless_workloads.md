[Knative](http://www.knative.dev) is a Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads. It provides a set of middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party data center. Knative components are built on Kubernetes and codify the best practices shared by successful real-world Kubernetes-based frameworks.  Knative components focus on solving many mundane but difficult tasks such as: 

* Deploying a container  
* Orchestrating source-to-URL workflows on Kubernetes 
* Routing and managing traffic with blue/green deployment 
* Automatic scaling and sizing workloads based on demand 
* Binding running services to eventing ecosystems 

This talk describes how Knative enables you to focus just on writing interesting code, without worrying about the “boring but difficult” parts of building, deploying, and managing an application. It shows how developers can even use familiar idioms, languages, and frameworks to deploy any workload: functions, applications, or containers.
