Have you ever felt uninspired by the every-day grind? Like coding is all work and no play?

Come with me as I take you on a whistle-stop tour of delightful SVG animations. Iâ€™ll also ask for some audience participation, as interaction is what makes motion on the web so fun!

By the end of this talk, you will feel enthused and inspired to make your own creative web animations with SVG.
