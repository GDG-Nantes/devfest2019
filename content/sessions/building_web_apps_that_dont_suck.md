As developers, it's important to think about our users first: you need to create an awesome experience and part of the equation is to deliver quality, fast. Unfortunately, we lost the habit of being efficient with our code and assets, getting used, if you are lucky, to more and more power from our devices and internet connections. But our users want their data now. Waiting is painful, you know it! It's not an option anymore... Based on personal experience, this presentation is about concrete tips and tricks to help you optimize your masterpiece, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (most applicable to other languages).
