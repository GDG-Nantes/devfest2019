We will demonstrate Mozilla’s WebThings Gateway, an IoT framework to protect user privacy and security, and to improve cross-brand interoperability. We will also show how to develop and build your own custom "web things" out of microcontroller boards then get “hands-on” using MicroBlocks.

Hands-on :
To participate in microcontroller programming using MicroBlocks, come to the workshop with MicroBlocks pre-installed. You can download the installer for your operating system and follow the setup instructions.
