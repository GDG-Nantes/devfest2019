In this talk, I will give an update on the  Capabilities project at Google, also known as project Fugu. In the context of this project, we work on closing the app gap by suggesting, standardizing, and trialing new APIs on the Web Platform. Some APIs that we look at include Wake Lock, Native File System, Shape Detection, WebNFC, Contact Picker, and several others (http://bit.ly/fugu-bugs). The exact list of the to-be-covered APIs is not yet known at this stage, but it will be an exciting collection, this I can promise :-)
