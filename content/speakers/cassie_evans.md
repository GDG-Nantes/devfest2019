Cassie has a lot of love for animation, especially animation on the web. 

She can usually be found tinkering on Codepen and nerding out about colour palettes and micro-interactions.

She is a core organiser of codebar Brighton, a non-profit initiative that runs free programming workshops and currently works as a Front-end Developer at Clearleft in Brighton.
