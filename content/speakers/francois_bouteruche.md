I'm currently Delevoper Relations Manager at Microsoft France. I am a tech enthusiast with a strong background around .NET development and DevOps phylosophy and practices. 

I have a PhD  in Computer Science. I worked several years around handwriting recognition and pen-based interfaces so I'm very familiar with all the real stuff behind the buzz words AI and Machine Learning :) I led the R&D team at Evodia, the ancestor of [Script and Go](http://www.scriptandgo.com/en)

After the fall of Evodia during the 2008-2010 financial crisis, I joined Orange Applications for Business, a subsidiary of Orange, where I focused on Application Lifecycle Management, Agile methodologies and then DevOps practices. I worked at the technical board of the company reporting to the CTO, [Philippe Ensarguet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippeensarguet).

After 5 years, I joined [Younited Credit](https://www.younited-credit.com) at the beginning of its scaling stage to help them moving to a public cloud provider (Azure) and setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery best practices.

My last move was the beginning of my story at Microsoft :)

I regularly talk at conferences such as Tech Days, EclipseCon France, API Days, Paris Open Source Summit, Cloud Expo Europe...
