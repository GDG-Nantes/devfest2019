François has come to professional level programming after a long and varied course of study. From medicine to micro mechanics and mechatronics, civil aviation and microtechnologies, he has studied several fields of study. This inevitably leads to... A constant need discovery! So obviously, when we arrive at the time of IoT ... what better field to have fun and, while we're there, produce systems useful to everyone?
