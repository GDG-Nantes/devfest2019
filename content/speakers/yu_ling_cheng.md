What attracted Yu Ling to web development was being able to get visible results and bring value quickly. After an 8-month entrepreneurial adventure she joined Theodo to sharpen her CTO skills and build apps to grow businesses. Today, as a lead developer, she puts her energy on growing a DevUx culture on each project and spread the concept worldwide, to improve collaboration between designers and developers. This also implies making mockup integration smoother by identifying best practice in styling and CSS and training developers.

Co-Author of the [DevUx Manifest](https://devux.now.sh/manifest) which explains the mindset to have as a developer or a designer when building an app, and the different levels of DevUx collaboration.
Developing [Happy Frontend](https://happyfrontend.now.sh/dev/learn), an interface to help developers learn CSS layout in 6 steps through small exercices and train on their own mockups.
