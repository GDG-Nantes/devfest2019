Into the Android development since Froyo when Fragment was just a myth, former Android engineer at CINEMUR, I am currently working at InnovOrder as Senior Android Engineer where we are bringing restaurants to the next level.
Besides that, I am a world traveler and a beer lover always looking for the best IPAs!
