I discovered IT since I was 8, and I fall in love with it and never stop since then. I'm working as an IT engineer since 2004, as developer, lead-developer, technical expert and solutions architect, in various services company on various fields including bank, insurance, transport, media, telecommunication, services..., using both web and mobile technologies (Java EE, PHP, Angular, Ionic, NodeJS, Objective-C, Swift, Android (Java), ...).

Recently I got particularly interested by both Blockchain and Deep learning technologies.
